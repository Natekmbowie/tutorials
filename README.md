# tutorials

Started creating a github for content I write, ended up deciding to move my entire site (only a couple of pages) as well. The main couple of pages are just my site talking about a couple of things I do. The /tutorials portion of the repo are all Creative Commons guides/tutorials/ramblings (licensed CC-AT-SA).
