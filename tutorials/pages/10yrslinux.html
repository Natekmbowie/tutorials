<br>
A little over a decade ago Windows 8 was entirely unusable for me. I&#8217;m
not referring to the mobile-style UI and bloat that marked a change in
Windows, but I mean unusable in the none dramatic sense of the word:
i.e. I couldn&#8217;t get more than a day or two before my installation would
brick itself. After many, many reinstalls and figuring out it was a
particular update to blame, I went about trying to apply the band-aid
approach that would at least give me more than a few hours worth of
usage per OS installation before my computer bricked: which was trying
to disable updates. I belt and suspenders approached it, both deferring
updates in settings and set the WiFi network the device was connected
to as a metered internet connection (or whatever the terminology was,
it&#8217;s been a decade so I might have misremembered those terms).<br>
<br>
Even if it was far from ideal, I was elated &#8211; my teenage self was a
computer wiz that found a temporary fix rendering my computer useful
again until a long-term fix was found. That sense of accomplishment
quickly dissipated though, as shortly after when starting my computer I
was greeted by an installing updates screen, followed by my computer
bricking itself yet again. Despite disabling updates in two different
ways, Microsoft came in and decided that my preferences didn&#8217;t apply
because they deemed whatever update too important for some lowly
peasant such as myself to refuse. After a lot of searching, I finally
figured out how to truly remedy the problem by disabling the Windows
update service altogether, but immediately decided I needed to find
another solution &#8211; which brought me to the topic of this post: Linux.<br>
<br>
From then on I had the pretty stereotypical Linux journey: i.e.
installing Ubuntu and leveraging its ease of use and beginner
friendliness, then a few months later pivoting to something that didn&#8217;t
give me Amazon search results on my desktop. Sometime later Windows 8.1
came out, and while still Windows, at least was functional; and
combined with my need for Windows specific software for school I
stopped using Linux exclusively. While games and software for school,
then college (Uni for you sophisticated Europeans), then work required
Windows (often that I couldn&#8217;t get to work in Wine) I&#8217;ve gotten by
using combinations of duel booting and VMs, never willing to switch
back to Windows full time.<br>
<br>
Today, in this post, I would like to go over why I use Linux, what I
use, and some potential plans for future usage. I don&#8217;t have any
particular goal to convince you of anything, nor do I guarantee this
post will be perfectly cohesive and linear, but I want to chronicle my
journey here and speak about what I use and why.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h2>Part II: Why</h2>
Okay, so I went over why I initially gave Linux a go, but now that
Windows is usable I wanted to go over why I still go out of my way to
Linux it as opposed to something like Windows. I wanted to give it a
fair bit of thought here, and really analyze it. To start I&#8217;ll list
some things that aren&#8217;t truly why I&#8217;m going out of my way to run Linux.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
First, I&#8217;m not on Linux because it&#8217;s more secure. Sure, much more
malware is made for Windows desktops than Linux desktops, so you&#8217;re
more likely to stumble upon malware for Windows; however, Windows also
takes that into account and runs AV in the background all the time. AV
does a good job at detecting old malware, so stumbling into old
existing malware isn&#8217;t as huge of a risk as one might consider it. It&#8217;s
the newly written malware by people who at least sort of know what they
are doing that is the risk, stuff that won&#8217;t be detected by AV, and is
well placed and/or targeted towards me. This could be generic
targeting, such as malicious software in Google Adwords going after
specific operating systems or keywords related to them, or a particular
attack against me specifically. In either of those cases, both
antivirus and security through obscurity would not provide me with much
in terms of tangible benefits. Further, there are also plenty of cross
platform programming languages (e.g. Java) that can effect any
operating system in a similar way. For these reasons safety from
malware comes down to user behavior, and I would not consider myself
secure from malware on Linux.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Next, Linux isn&#8217;t necessarily more stable than Windows either. Now,
sure, I got into Linux because Windows 8 was unstable to the point of
being unusable, but that&#8217;s sort of an exception. I might expect Debian
(and some of its forks) to be more stable than Windows, and a Linux
server is expected to be more stable than a Windows server (which is
why Microsoft uses Linux servers), but that&#8217;s not always the case. For
me running Debian I do expect it to be a tad more stable than Windows
10, but after some thought, this isn&#8217;t a deciding factor, and depending
on the distro in use Windows could actually end up being way more
stable than Linux.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Further, I&#8217;m not on Linux because it&#8217;s a modern, efficient operating
system built from the ground up. Sure, Windows might be legacy code,
built on legacy code, with a sleek-looking modern bit of code on top.
To quote Bill Gates: &#8220;if you can&#8217;t make it work good, make it look
good.&#8221; In most FOSS (free and open source software) projects, as
opposed to proprietary software, you&#8217;ll find less code doing more work;
making it less bloated and more functional. While I am stepping a bit
out of my depth; Linux, however, isn&#8217;t free of this legacy code or
inefficiencies either. From the &#8216;everything is a file&#8217; Unix philosophy,
to some desktop environments still being built to act as if they&#8217;re
connecting to a remote display server, there&#8217;s plenty of legacy code to
go around in Linux as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So, if I just listed off reasons that weren&#8217;t quite deciding factors,
then what are the reasons? Well, I have a few, but they pretty much
boil down to control and licensing. To break them down further, first,
there&#8217;s the lack of bloat. Sure, occasionally distros ship with what
some (including myself) would consider bloat &#8211; I&#8217;m looking at you
Canonical; but there&#8217;s no such thing on Linux as being unable to
uninstall a manufacturer installed application. Most distros only ship
with some basic utilities which can be removed at will, and then it&#8217;s
up to the user to add or remove whatever they see fit. This is not to
mention there&#8217;s also a lack of a million Microsoft features,
components, and services filling up your hard drive unnecessarily and
taking up processing resources.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Speaking of adding or removing anything you see fit, the next aspect is
the control over your own operating system aspect of Linux. As I
mentioned, you can add or remove components at will, but this goes well
beyond what somebody unfamiliar with Linux might think this includes.
Even basic system components like your desktop environment can be
replaced, giving you way more options than on other systems.
Touchscreens are popular now, so plenty of desktops need to cater to
those, but what if you don&#8217;t want that? Well, if you&#8217;re on Windows
you&#8217;re out of luck, but on Linux you&#8217;re a few words in the terminal
away from changing that. Of course you can pick and choose way more
components than your desktop, but it&#8217;s a great example of something
customizable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
However, this control goes well beyond just customization. Remember how
when I deferred Windows updates, then set my WiFi to metered (which
disables installing updates over it) and Windows still updated? Well,
that doesn&#8217;t happen on Linux. When I tell my computer to do something,
it does it, and I don&#8217;t have to worry about some company deciding they
know better than I do and doing something anyway. Further, adjacent to
control - and another big reason I&#8217;m on Linux, is privacy. Windows is
full of telemetry, and I can never fully know or trust what information
they&#8217;re collecting, but on Linux when I disable telemetry (if even
applicable) I can trust it&#8217;s not collecting info.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Yet another reason why I&#8217;m on Linux is its efficiency. I&#8217;ve heard
people say &#8220;Linux is free unless you value your time,&#8221; but I feel it&#8217;s
actually quite the opposite. Of course it does take time to familiarize
yourself with the system, but in my usage Linux has certainly saved me
time in the long run. The biggest one is of course the terminal, which
while looking scary at first, can accomplish tasks by typing three or
four words instead of a minute or so of navigating GUIs on Windows.
Similarly, homemade scripts that took me three minutes to write can
save me probably ~15-30 seconds each time I run them (e.g. opening
Firefox in a separate profile for homemade web apps, without requiring
Firefox to always prompt me to choose a profile at launch or to switch
profiles while running). The efficiency at which you can operate Linux
once you&#8217;ve learned it can make a huge difference once you start
thinking of each little bit of time you&#8217;ve saved each day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Last, there&#8217;s the ideological component as well. And yeah, I know that
ideologies and the internet don&#8217;t go hand and hand all too well (or
really well, depending on what you consider well), but this one&#8217;s
luckily not too controversial. Basically, the ideology here is that
everybody should be able to access the software freely, review its
code, and do with it what they please with their systems running said
code answering to them and not some developer or company. Call it
communism or call it libertarianism, regardless, it&#8217;s something I feel
strongly about and a driving factor in why I&#8217;m writing this on Linux.<br>
<br>
<h2>Part III: What I use</h2>
Now, as much as I joked about ideology being the controversial part of
this post, here&#8217;s the real controversial part: my favorite setup, and
how everybody who does something slightly different is entirely wrong.
At a certain point I came to an understanding about how distros and
forks worked, and realized Ubuntu was just Debian + pissware; so I
migrated over to Debian and have continued to use it since. Maybe deep
down I&#8217;m still traumatized by Windows 8, but stability is a high
priority for me and it&#8217;s worked well. I have experimented with
Slackware, Arch, and everything in between; but if you exclude Gallium
which ran for a bit on my Chromebook the only bare metal installation
I&#8217;ve had in the last eight or so years has been Debian.<br>
<br>
The biggest complaint about Debian people often have is that software
can get outdated in terms of features on a stable release, but for me
it hasn&#8217;t really been an issue. Browser updates and security updates
come through, so there&#8217;s no fear there, and most of the time for me it
doesn&#8217;t matter if the version of a tool installed via the native
repository has lagging feature updates or not (e.g. I&#8217;ve been using
Libre Office forever now, and at no point have I really noticed any
changes that I couldn&#8217;t have lived without). Even in the event that you
really need features not in the repo yet, however, Appimages, Flatpaks,
and Snaps can fix that.<br>
<br>
As a recent example, Prism Launcher (a FOSS 3rd party Minecraft
launcher) doesn&#8217;t come with the latest version of Java bundled as the
official Minecraft launcher does, and the then latest version of Java
wasn&#8217;t added in the Bullseye repo so it couldn&#8217;t be installed natively&#8230;
except I was already intending to install it as a Flatpak (which auto
installs the Java dependency as a Flatpak). The only reason I even
realized it could have been a potential issue is because it was pointed
out on the installation page. In general, with the exception of desktop
environments (and I use XFCE which never changes), it&#8217;s super easy to
get all the latest and greatest when desired while also getting the
stability not possible else ware. Otherwise, in the super rare
circumstances where I need something newer like while compiling an app
image I can just spin up an Arch VM.<br>
<br>
The other major issue would be hardware compatibility &#8211; which of course
can&#8217;t be resolved with Flatpaks. Since the Linux Kernel in Debian lags
behind other distros you can&#8217;t run Debian on the first day of release
for the latest hardware. At least for me anyway, that&#8217;s not usually an
issue. Heck, my laptop is seven years old, and my other computer is a
used Chromebook I picked up a couple of years ago that was released 8
years ago.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Big Distros I don&#8217;t Use</span><br>
And I get it, as hard as it is to believe, some people make the wrong
choice and do different things than I do. Lol, but seriously, there are
a few other options as well. I&#8217;ve heard some people say that Fedora is
a great mix between Debian and a rolling release like Arch; which I&#8217;ve
toyed around with a bit and it seems to be good. Maybe not quite as
much compiled for it or documented about it as Debian and Debian-based
distros, but given Red Hat got Flatpaks going that kinda makes the
former a moot criticism. I still prefer Debian for the reasons
mentioned above, but I can understand why somebody might come to a
different conclusion.<br>
<br>
There&#8217;s also Arch, likely the best and most popular rolling release.
I&#8217;ve heard Arch described as a hobbyist&#8217;s distro, and I don&#8217;t think
that&#8217;s the best way to put it. I&#8217;d describe it as a tinkerer&#8217;s distro
since it mandates somebody has at least a cursory understanding of
their system and enjoys maintaining it. Or, of course, they like to
have the latest hardware from day one and like to tinker with those
sorts of things and are stuck with the software side of maintenance.<br>
<br>
I do love to tinker on my computer, but not with my computer. I enjoy
firing up a VM with something new on it or toying with some newish
protocol or something to see how it all works. What I don&#8217;t like to do
though is tinker in such a way that I risk breaking my computer. The
last thing I want to do is be on or just getting off a twelve-hour
shift of fixing a bunch of systems that aren&#8217;t doing what they&#8217;re
supposed to do, only to find that some update had a manual intervention
I didn&#8217;t read up on and end up bricking my computer, or end up with
dependency requirements that mess up my software; or something similar
to that.<br>
<br>
That said, you could presumably glean that if I&#8217;m on Debian over
Fedora, then I&#8217;m certainly not looking for a rolling release. Though
there is a bit of irony in how opposite releases can end up in the same
place, and I could end up with almost the exact same software on Debian
as someone running Arch. So first is the desktop, right? You can&#8217;t use
that through a Flatpak so it has to be older on Debian, except one of
the things I&#8217;ve heard is that stability wise it&#8217;s best to use XFCE or a
tiling window manager on Arch that stays roughly the same since being
on the cutting edge of something like GNOME or Plasma might end up
breaking stuff &#8211; so our desktops could be the same in either distro.
Oh, and from what I&#8217;ve heard if you install too many packages natively
on Arch (especially through the AUR) you run the risk of dependency
conflicts and the like, so some people might run a good portion of
their software through self-contained packages like Flatpaks &#8211; which
would be the same regardless of the distro.<br>
<br>
And the last thing is that, for stability, some Arch users use an LTS
Kernal. At that point, if they did everything I just mentioned, sure
Arch would be pretty stable; but at that point they constructed a
stable release of Linux with extra steps. If not though, I guess each
time someone on less stable releases bricks their system it&#8217;s one less
bug to risk bricking mine. Ooh, and I just thought of a second funny
jab. Everybody says Arch is the endgame of Linux, but the
endgame-endgame is when you run out of hair to pull out after each time
your system bricks and you switch to something more stable. Alright,
I&#8217;ll stop bugging Arch users now, otherwise they&#8217;ll insult me using big
words and technical terms I don&#8217;t know.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Forks and Other Distros</span><br>
Further, beyond the three distros mentioned above there are plenty of
other ones as well. There&#8217;s a few like Slackware that are unique and
built from scratch, and a few like Puppy Linux which are based on other
distros but heavily modified to fit a particular purpose. Otherwise,
however, when it comes to personal desktop Linux distros most of them
are forks of the aforementioned three (or forks of those forks) that
don&#8217;t bring much to the table aside from a different default desktop
environment and system utilities. In most cases I prefer going with the
project that the fork was based on and installing any software or
desktop environments that were sought out, and I would recommend
anybody do the same. While installing the software manually might seem
slightly more inconvenient, usually you&#8217;d be trading off slower
adoption of security patches, potential instability, and more bloat for
a few less sentences in the terminal.<br>
<br>
I would make an exception for something like Linux Mint (and maybe
Pop-OS or the newer trendy distros that I&#8217;m not too familiar with),
even if I wouldn&#8217;t use them myself. For somebody just trying out Linux,
something like Mint comes pre-configured with a nice desktop, graphical
software store, and proprietary driver options out of the box. While
it&#8217;s only a few commands in Debian to get a similar setup (Mint is
based on Ubuntu, which is based on Debian), for a new user who&#8217;s
learning the system having everything setup in such a way brings a lot
of value. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Desktop Environments</span><br>
Last, beyond the distro, the next biggest choice in Linux would be the
desktop environment (or tiling window manager if you want to go old
school). As mentioned before, I&#8217;ve used XFCE for a while, and it&#8217;s
definitely kind of a modernized XP feel (or any Windows versions before
they got into the touchscreen market). I always remove the bottom bar
with the shortcuts, then move the top bar to the bottom, and I think
that&#8217;s what&#8217;s best for me. I can hit the Applications button then power
off/sleep/hibernate/log off in two clicks, or hover over an application
category and click on one in it. I got running applications to the
right of that, and on the right-hand side of the task bar I have the
time and other utilities, plus the option to switch between desktops
for multitasking.<br>
<br>
Sure, something like GNOME seems nice and flashy, but overall it feels
more like tablet or phone software. You got the power options on the
top right, the shortcuts on the left sidebar, then a button to pull up
all applications in a grid view and it just seems something not as
efficient for a mouse. Though again, as much as I&#8217;ve been joking about
there being only my choice or the wrong choice, it all really just
comes down to personal preferences.<br>
<br>
<h2>Part IV: Future Plans, Schemes, and Other Mischievous Plots</h2>
Finally, closing this post up, I wanted to talk about what I&#8217;m planning
in the future here. As of the first draft of this post I&#8217;m currently
duel booting Windows 10 and Debian, but that might change here soon.
Unlike in the past while in school, when it comes to work I&#8217;ve got a
separate company provided computer so there are no outside factors
forcing me to use Windows for personal use. The only real thing keeping
me on Windows alongside Linux until now has always been games. With
that, if I think I might play some games I might as well be running
Windows, and since I&#8217;m running Windows I might as well do other stuff
while on it, and since I&#8217;m doing all this stuff here I need to allocate
more space of my hard drive (or relegate a Linux install to external
media for a bit when my hard drive dies and I pick up a 380 GB
replacement), etc.<br>
<br>
A few months ago though I found out about Steam Proton, which if you&#8217;re
unaware is Steam&#8217;s solution for running Windows games on Linux (similar
to Wine). While it makes sense given I&#8217;ve been aware Steam OS and the
Steam Deck are both Linux based and it wouldn&#8217;t make sense to buy a
portable console only compatible with a fraction of the games on the
market; I wasn&#8217;t aware of it and got a happy surprise to see it
existed. I&#8217;ve got a few games I cycle in and out of playing and having
successfully booted them all into Proton (minus Minecraft, which is
Java-based and cross-platform) I can say that they all run well, and in
the case of games for older versions of Windows like Fallout 3, works
out of the box even when it won&#8217;t on Windows 10.<br>
<br>
I&#8217;m not a huge gamer, so as long as my favorites run I&#8217;m not too picky
otherwise. I have no qualms with using a game streaming service or just
not playing games that I can&#8217;t get to run through Proton, and maybe in
the future if I buy a device powerful enough I might toy with
pass-through virtualization if I really want to play something I
otherwise can&#8217;t. Beyond that, I&#8217;ve pretty much migrated all of my
functionality over, from ISO burning to MTP file transfers; the kind of
things I&#8217;ve done out of habit on Windows but are only one alternative
piece of software away from having the same functionality.<br>
<br>
It&#8217;s been probably a month or so since I booted up Windows except to
migrate stuff over whenever I need something I can't just grab by
mounting the main Windows partition. It&#8217;s taken me about a decade, but
at some point soon I plan to overwrite the Windows partitions once and
for all, possibly also upgrading to a larger SSD while I&#8217;m at it. It
only took me a decade to do so, but hey, maybe I can tell myself it&#8217;s
got some sort of significance being around the ten-year mark.<br>
<br>
I can&#8217;t say for certain that right after doing this I won&#8217;t run into an
issue flashing a device or doing something else that requires very
specific software; then find myself needing to spin up a temporary
Windows installation again. Regardless, though, that&#8217;s future me&#8217;s
problem. I hope you enjoyed this somewhat long read, even if it was
kinda opinionated and all over the place.<br>
