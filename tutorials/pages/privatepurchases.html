<span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchasing physical items online with
increased privacy or near anonymity.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">A quick virtual pamphlet to explain
the ways in which you can increase your privacy or attempt to be
entirely anonymous while purchasing anything online.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Originally posted 9/19/2021 on Hive.Blog,
R/WallstreetSilver, and Smashwords</span>.<br>
<br>
So, you wish to purchase something online while protecting your
personal privacy? In this quick document I will outline the ways in
which you can achieve that. This guide will mainly focus on two levels
of privacy. The first level will focus on more standard privacy, which
will make it harder for an individual to get details about you such as
your name and address. This will mainly focus on requiring several
layers of &#8216;exposure&#8217; to get to your identity. For this document,
&#8216;exposure&#8217; is defined as records being accessed, be it from a hack,
malicious actor with legitimate access, a malicious online store, or a
subpoena (though if you are actually under investigation from a
government entity they will just subpoena all required sets of records).<br>
<br>
The second level, for the more paranoid of us, will aim to make it very
difficult for anybody to retroactively determine your identity from
your purchase based on any stored records. That said, if you were
currently being investigated by the government it probably will not
help you, though there is very little that could actually get you into
trouble that you could buy online from a legitimate online web store.<br>

<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Your Internet Connection</big><br>
Normally, if you are using your home internet with a normal browser
there are two main things that may identify you: your IP address and
browser cookies. When browsing a website your IP address will likely be
logged by the website and your ISP (internet service provider) will log
the fact that you loaded that specific site; though your ISP will be
unable to see the content transmitted assuming that the site is
encrypted using https. Your IP can trace you back to a specific
geographical location, but you generally cannot be identified
personally unless your ISP&#8217;s records of your IP address(s) are exposed.<br>
<br>
Cookies, which are small files identifying your browser, on the other
hand, may be able to easily identify you. The site you access may place
their own cookies on your browser for purposes such as tracking what
pages you have viewed or identifying what user account you have signed
in to. Additionally, however, tools like Google Analytics (which are
implemented into a large number of sites) track your usage across the
web and will link your activity across any site which implemented such
tools.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Finding Privacy Regarding Your Internet
Connection</big><br>
With an exception to cookies, your internet connection has a decent
baseline when it comes to the privacy of purchases when compared to
other aspects of an online purchase (at least relatively speaking).
Aside from details entered on a website (such as a name and address),
in order to get the details of content exchanged the data from both the
site of the purchase and the data from your ISP would have to be
exposed. Nevertheless, there are actions that can still be taken to
increase your privacy.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies (lvl 1)</span>: The easiest
way to greatly increase your privacy while purchasing items online is
to prevent tracking from cookies. Your best bet is to simply browse the
online store in the incognito mode of your browser, or better yet set
your browser to clear cookies automatically.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Public WiFi (lvl 2ish):</span> In
order to prevent an ISP from knowing that you accessed a specific site
the easiest way to go about this may be to use public WiFi. By doing this
there is no way of knowing that it was your device on that network that
loaded the site. Though it always used to be a bad idea to process a
payment on public WiFi in the past, now that most sites use https you
are likely fairly safe. That said, there are three things you must take
into consideration. First, you must make sure that your device is using
a random MAC address. A MAC address is an identifier for your device,
and the public WiFi may be logging MAC addresses and associating them
with network usage. Many devices now allow you to use a randomized MAC
address, however, so be sure to set it up to use a unique MAC address
each time it connects to a network. Secondly, make sure your device&#8217;s
screen cannot be seen by any cameras. Last, there must be others using
the WiFi network while you are using it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">VPNs (lvl 2):</span> Usually, your
connection goes from your device, through your ISP, then to the
server(s) hosting the web store (albeit a bit of an
oversimplification). Using a VPN, however, your connection goes through
your ISP to the VPN servers, then from the VPN servers to the server(s)
hosting the web store. Assuming the VPN does not log your connections
(which any good VPN will not), and assuming the VPN is not malicious
and is not hacked (which, for example, Nord VPN has been several
times); then your ISP can see you are using a VPN, and the web store
can see you are using a VPN, but they will never end up knowing more
than that.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tor (lvl 2):</span> Tor (a.k.a. &#8216;The
Onion Router&#8217;) functions similar to a VPN, however, it routes your
traffic through three different servers instead of the standard one
that a VPN will, making it the holy grail of anonymity. Tor is free,
open source, and can run with minimal configuration.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Payment Processing</big><br>
Payments can be the hardest or the easiest portion of this guide,
depending on what your limitations are and what you intend to achieve.
In the last twenty years there have been a lot of increased scrutiny on
the financial system put into place to attempt to combat bad actors,
but most of that is on the receiving end of money&#8212;and compared to what
it could be in the future the nature of money could very well still be
the wild west.<br>
<br>
The goal of this section is to explain how you can prevent your
purchase from easily being attached to your name in real time or
retroactively. Some of these methods can end up costing you more then
if you were to just use your credit card, and most may consume extra
time, but if you are reading this then you are probably willing to
consider those trade offs. Some of these may require in person actions,
so consider checking out the fourth section of this document.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Virtual Credit Cards (lvl 1):</span>
There are a number of virtual credit card companies such as Privacy.com
popping up, which allow you to create a virtual credit card that can be
used under any name and disabled at any time. This is useful to hide
your name from any online store, and deter fraudulent use of your
credit card, though the virtual card company will still see a payment
to the online store.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alias/Authorized User/DBA (lvl 1):</span>
If avoiding giving your name to an online store is all you are looking
to do, it is possible to just invent an alias and use the modern
banking services we are all used to. Before you get worried I&#8217;m going
to start talking about fraud and money laundering, there are actually a
number of mundane and legal ways to go about this. First, you could add
an authorized user to your existing credit card under an alias and use
that to prevent being required to give your real name when processing a
credit card. Secondly, (assuming you&#8217;re American) you can go to the IRS
and get an EIN (employer identification number) for said &#8216;alias&#8217; and
cosign a credit card application with your real name (to get around no
credit score on the EIN) to get a real credit card under the so called
&#8216;alias&#8217;. Finally, you could file a DBA (or jurisdictional equivalent
such as an &#8216;assumed name certificate&#8217;) to go with your &#8216;alias&#8217; and EIN
to open a bank account under the other name. Consider this a poor man&#8217;s
shell corporation without the legal complication of a shell corporation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prepaid Cards &amp; Gift Cards (lvl
2): </span>You
ever notice that nearly every corner store, gas station, and super
market seem to have a bunch of gift cards and prepaid visas? Well you
can always buy one of those with cash and then use that. The gift cards
usually have no fee, but are limited to only a specific service; and
the visa cards usually work anywhere within your country, but have a
small fee attached.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Crypto: (lvl 1 or 2): </span>You can
buy crypto through a service like Coinbase and use that on any web
store for level one privacy as you will not give the store your name or
personal details through the transaction. If you want level two you
have two options: first, you can buy crypto through a method that does
not require personal details (such as with cash or prepaid visas); or
you can buy it through methods like Coinbase and then move it around a
few times, such as converting it to Monero and back several times. That
said, between tools like Cipher Trace having unknown capabilities&#8212;and
moving crypto around to hide it&#8217;s origin possible counting as money
laundering&#8212;I can&#8217;t recommend doing that in any normal situation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Money Orders (lvl 2): </span>Despite
the fact that you cannot cash a money order or check (or cheque, as you
sophisticated people would spell it), sending a money order using cash
is standard procedure. You can hand over the cash, fill out the money
order, and mail it without any form of ID and sign it with any name. I
actually new a guy who said he signed &#8220;Daffy Duck&#8221; on things like this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Shipping and Receiving</big><br>
This is probably the hardest part, since you actually need to pick it
up from an address that you (presumably) have permission to ship to.
That said, there are a number of ways to do this. If you are planning
to simply avoid having the web store find your real name and/or home
address there are a number of ways you can go about it, and there are
still ways to go above and beyond.<br>
<br>
Credit where credit is due, the last
two methods are ripped strait from J.J. Luna&#8217;s book<span style="font-style: italic;"> How to Become
Invisible, third edition.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alias and Home Address (lvl 1):</span>
If all you want to do is keep the web store from knowing your name, you
can always just ship a purchase to your home address under a different
name.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PO Boxes, etc (lvl 1):</span> There
are a large number of services that allow you to collect mail at a
different address then your home address. From PO boxes, FedEx or UPS
boxes, and mail forwarding services, these all allow you to collect
mail without it being shipped to your home. Additionally, more one time
services such as general delivery at post offices and amazon lockers
allow you to pick up shipments on a more one time usage (and are
generally free). You almost always need ID to use one of these services
(though some smaller private mail forwarding/collection services may
not require ID), however, you can usually still receive mail under
different names if you have registered it as a DBA or jurisdictional
equivalent.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hotels (lvl 1 or 2):</span> If you are
staying at hotels, motels, or airbnbs then you can probably ship mail
to that location. However, most (but not all) places will require an ID
and/or a credit card for a security deposit.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Local Local Businesses (lvl 2):</span>
It could be possible for you to ask around (best bet is on sites like
Craigslist or equivalents) and see if a small business a bit of a
distance away would be willing to receive your mail in exchange for a
few bucks.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Uninhabited Properties (lvl 2): </span>If
you know of any uninhabited properties (from abandon warehouses to
houses that are for sale but uninhabited), and you are able to track
when the shipment will arrive, you could probably ship your mail to
that property and pick it up when it&#8217;s arrived. It probably would not
be morally or legally stealing since that would be your package, but
I&#8217;m unsure if that&#8217;d be totally legal to ship to a property you do not
own or have permission to ship to; as well as possible trespassing
violations. If you did this you would probably want to bring a receipt
for the shipment on the off chance you were questioned, as it probably
would not look good if you were taking mail from a property you did not
have permission to be on that did not match the name on your ID.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">In Person Anonymity</big><br>
To most people, going somewhere in person seems to provide the most
privacy, while doing something online seems to provide the least.
However, if you understand how to achieve privacy using tech then the
reverse is actually true. This section of the guide is meant to provide
you with a basic guide to &#8216;flying under the radar&#8217; so to speak when
performing actions in person (from picking up packages to buying items).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Picking a Location: </span>To begin,
you first need to choose where you will be. Your best bet is to go
several towns or even a city away. Furthermore, if what you are buying
is from a store, choose one you are rarely (if ever) in.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting to the Location: </span>It
really doesn&#8217;t matter how you get to the area, but it does matter that
you walk the final distance. If you drove, rode a bike, or took public
transport then make sure to stop a couple of blocks away and walk the
rest of the distance. Yes, there may be records of you being in the
area, but that is not important as long as there are no easy records of
you traveling to that specific location. This certainly would not be a
good strategy if you were committing a crime (or at least a serious
crime), but if you are just looking to fly under the radar then it
doesn&#8217;t matter that there are records of you being in a city, only that
there are no records of you being a specific person at a specific store
(or other intended location).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cell Phones: </span>There is no need
for you to buy a burner phone or leave your personal at home. Just turn
it on airplane mode and then wrap it in tin foil (or another signal
blocking method) to prevent it from pinging cell towers. Please note
that it is supposedly possible for some cell phones, even ones
uncompromised with malware or other malicious software, to ping a cell
tower or operate other wireless communication while in airplane mode or
while turned off&#8212;so signal blocking using tin foil and the like is
still useful. If you really need an electronic device bring a tablet
with the location, WiFi, and Bluetooth turned off and do not connect it
to the internet while you are near the location. If you really need a
device for GPS use that tablet, but make sure that the maps software is
not storing your location/history and the location is turned off before
you get to the location you are going. If you are on Android consider
trying OSMand.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clothing: </span>Most of your
clothing
does not matter too much, just make sure to wear clothing that does not
stand out and that hides any tattoos or other marking features of your
body. A hat is also good for hiding your face a bit, especially from
cameras. Gloves, if they do not stand out, will prevent fingerprints
(but gloves themselves can sometimes leave a unique print), however,
this is not something to worry about unless you are planning on
committing some sort of crime and thus outside of this guide.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Facial Recognition:</span> With many
city governments and business now applying facial recognition to all
individuals within the vicinity of the scanners, it now may be worth
addressing facial recognition regardless of whether you are actually
committing a crime or not (not that commuting crimes is recommended by
this guide). Facial recognition works by identifying mostly the eyes
and shape of the face, though some more advanced ones can now identify
you based on things such as your walk as well. That said, hiding your
face will be your best bet, and a nondescript brimmed hat to block your
face entirely from certain angles is a good start. Additionally, since
eyes are the focus a pair of sunglasses are the next logical step.
However, since many cameras use infrared light you may need a special
pair of sunglasses to prevent your sunglasses from appearing completely
clear to the camera. You can pay like $400 for a pair of reflectables
brand glasses, or you can buy an $8 pair of infrared resistant
sunglasses intended to prevent second hand Infrared and UV exposure in
lab or welding environments.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Please note that while large amounts
of infrared or UV is dangerous (which is why those protective glasses
are made) infrared is naturally occurring. Some infrared cameras use
naturally occurring infrared light, and some make a small amount of
their own, but do not worry your eyes are not in danger from infrared
capable cameras.</span><br>
<br>
Finally, regarding facial recognition, a mask may be a useful tool. In
the past it would have drawn too much attention, and in many
jurisdictions such as New York it was (and still technically is)
illegal to wear a mask in public; however, at the time of writing this
it is acceptable to wear a mask in public. A mask like a bandanna would
be best for anonymity, since it hides the shape of your entire face
instead of showing your cheekbone size in the case of a surgical/n95
mask, and is not tight enough to show your face&#8217;s outline like in the
case of a neck gator. That said, plenty of facial recognition software
was quickly updated to identify people wearing masks during 2020
(albeit with a lesser degree of accuracy), both because eyes are more
so the focus, and because surveillance always finds a way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Closing Notes</big><br>
I figured I&#8217;d leave the more boring monologue to the end here, so
continue on at your own risk. Anyway, I have been hanging around in the
virtual precious metals communities a bit lately and hear plenty of
sentiment regarding the need for privacy (which who can blame anybody
if you are storing literal gold or other precious metals at your home).
Now, I don&#8217;t have too much, and most all of it is ETFs in my Roth
(blasphemous, I know); but since I&#8217;m in tech I thought that something
like this might be found useful by some people. I&#8217;ve also heard about
plenty of issues in other areas, from online knife sellers in Australia
having issues to people just wanting privacy on sensitive purchases.<br>
<br>
Anyway, whether you are buying gold or sex toys, if you are looking for
privacy then I hope I helped you with this guide. As noted above, you
are free to redistribute this guide in any way you see fit. I&#8217;m just
going to toss it up on the internet and if you find it interesting then
